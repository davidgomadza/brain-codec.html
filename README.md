Thoughts to Word or Audio 
How It Works:

1. Input: Enter a word or thought (e.g., "son", "dream", "love").
2. Encode: Simulates the thought being converted to an electromagnetic wave and emitted from the Exit Port (right side of the brain).
3. Decode: Simulates capturing the wave at the Entry Port (left side), converting it back, and interpreting it using a simple database.
4. Visualization: Animated signal path between Exit and Entry ports.
5. CNB Integration: Simulates the "Central Nerve Bridge" capturing and processing thoughts.
